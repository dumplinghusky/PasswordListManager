# Password List Generator
Create a targeted password wordlist with patterns and known info.

## About

Humans include personal information in their passwords, information that can often be found on social media accounts, and can potentially be used by cybercriminals to crack passwords, such as:

* Their own name or the name of a family member
* Their petâ€™s name
* Their birthday
* Words related to their hobby
* Part of their home address
* The name of their favorite book or movie
* Celebrity names
* The name of the website the password is for

This program is an interactive list generator that will create a password wordlist and can be used in penetration testing and forensic investigations to crack passwords.
It also is going to be a utility to manage and trim wordlists but those features are still under development.

### Usage

Run the interactive program with:

> $python main.py

The password list will be created in the same folder in .txt

### Requirements

Python 3
